# API-Call-Example
To Run this application all you need to do is open the folder in IntelliJ and give it a minute to think..
Hit run. Another window may pop up. If it does just hit run again.

Once running it will ask you to input a ISO-4217 code. It will then display all of the information.

Note: I did have a bit of trouble to start with with Maven but I believe that was IntelliJ acting up.
I ended up invalidating the cache and restarting to fix it.

Thank you for your time# API-Call-Example
