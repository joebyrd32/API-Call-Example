# API-Call-Example
This is an API call example. It connects to coinbase and Binance to display information about
crypto currencies vs your selected currency and BitCoin.

To Run this application all you need to do is open the folder in IntelliJ and give it a minute to think.
Hit run. Another window may pop up. If it does just hit run again.

Once running it will ask you to input a ISO-4217 code. An easy one to use is "USD". It will then 
display all of the information.

Note: I did have a bit of trouble to start with with Maven but I believe that was IntelliJ acting up.
I ended up invalidating the cache and restarting to fix it.

Thank you for your time# API-Call-Example
